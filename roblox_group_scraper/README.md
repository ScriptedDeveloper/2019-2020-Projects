Lets you scrape for empty ROBLOX groups! Completely proxyless/cookies free! A part of my ROBLOX multitool.

# How to use it?
Just open main.py and enjoy!

# What to expect from it
It really depends on your luck. Sometimes you get a few empty groups in a half a hour, sometimes you only get one group in a hour.
